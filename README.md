## why and when:
I made this project in the summer of 2022 to prepare myself to be able to make a good intake game for the CMGT study at BUAS.
After this I did some more smaller projects and eventaully created my intake pinball game. 

## Learning C++ and SDL2
I made this matrix effect as an introduction to the SDL2 library and of course to practice my C++ skills. 
Making the effect was harder than I anticipated but it taught me a lot about the library and about pointers.

The biggest problem I ran into while making the program took place at the end. 
I had created my first ever data leak by unknowingly creating new pointers every frame. 
After a lot of searching I found the problem and managed to fix it quite easily.

I am very happy how this project turned out. 
The final result looks exactly how I wanted, and it proved to be a nice exercise to explore the sdl2 library and C++ pointers. 
It also showed that I will need to practice a lot more before being able to create a game myself. 
But I am excited to learn and explore and will continue to do so in the future.
